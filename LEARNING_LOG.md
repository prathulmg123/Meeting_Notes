## Project: Meeting Notes Application

### Setup and Installation
```bash
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start the application
python app.py

# For development with auto-reload
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

### Key Topics Learned
1. **Web Application Development**
   - Setting up a Flask web application
   - Handling HTTP requests and responses
   - Creating RESTful APIs

2. **Audio Processing**
   - Working with audio files (MP3, WAV)
   - Audio transcription and processing

3. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Text processing and analysis
   - Extracting key information from meeting notes

### Issues Faced and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Dependencies Installation
- **Problem**: Missing packages causing import errors
- **Solution**: Created `requirements.txt` to manage all dependencies

#### Issue 2: Audio Processing
- **Problem**: Compatibility issues with audio file formats
- **Solution**: Used standard audio libraries and ensured proper file format support

#### Issue 3: Performance Optimization
- **Problem**: Slow response time for large audio files
- **Solution**: Implemented chunk processing for large files

### Development Notes
- Keep the virtual environment activated while working on the project
- Always pull the latest changes before starting work
- Write tests for new features
- Document API endpoints and their expected request/response formats

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Implement meeting note summarization
- [ ] Add support for multiple audio formats
- [ ] Create a web interface for better user experience

### Helpful Commands
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version

# List installed packages
pip list

# Freeze dependencies
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Run tests (when available)
python -m pytest
```
